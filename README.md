# Weather Forecasting Tools

-The weather forecasting tool implemented in the code is a command-line application that retrieves and displays the current weather forecast for a specified city. It utilises the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on the city name provided by the user.
-The tool sends an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API, including the city name and an API key, to fetch the weather data. 
-The weather forecast for the city is displayed on the command line, showing the weather description, temperature in Celsius, humidity percentage, and wind speed in meters per second. 
-Our weather forecasting tool combines data retrieval from the OpenWeatherMap API, sentiment analysis using Azure Cognitive Services, geocoding with Azure Maps, storage in Azure Blob Storage, and analysis and visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib to provide a comprehensive weather forecast experience.
